# What I learned about Linux Fundamentals
 The terminal in linux is where you will be doing some if not most of your work so it is important to really understand and memorize basic commands if you are going to be working in the dev ops field or with linux a lot.
 The shell is important becuase it allows you to type and run the commands in order to work with Linux.

# Linux basic commands
## Navigation
1. ls (lists files)
2. cd (change your directory)
3. pwd (Will show the current path)
4. mkdir (It will create a new folder)

## File Management
1. rm (Removes a file)
2. cp (Will make a copy of a file)
3. mv (Move or rename a file)
4. cat (view a files contents)
5. nano the name of your file (It allows you to edit that file)

## System 
1. Sudo (Run as an admin)
2. chmod (change a files permission)
3. curl (Allows you to make a web request straight from the terminal)
